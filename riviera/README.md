RISC-V 64IC Implementation 

This project is an RISC-V 64IC core implementation with 5-stage pipeline on SystemVerilog HDL.
It is a part of the graduate course CS523: Digital Circuit Design Lab Using EDA Tools (Spring 2019) @ CSD, UOC.

Extentions of RISC-V:
    64I -> 64bit Base Integer Instruction Set.
    C -> Compressed   Instruction Set.

Members of the project:
