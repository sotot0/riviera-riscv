Source the script appropriate for your RISCV architecture:
- For RV32I
  > source rv32i-settings.sh
- For RV64I
  > source rv64i-settings.sh
- For RV64IC
  > source rv64ic-settings.sh

These scripts put in your path the RISC-V GCC 8.3.0 compiler and binutils
- for 32-bit the compiler binary is: riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc
- for 64-bit the compiler binary is: riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc

Example codes can be found inside the example directories with ready makefiles that generate files for simulation (.dat files)
Start from example0 which is the easiest and gradually move to more complex examples.
The compliance tests folder will generate many tests to confirm that your RISC-V processor implements all instructions according to the spec (this is for advanced use in the end).
